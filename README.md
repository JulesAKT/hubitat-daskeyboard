# hubitat-daskeyboard

This is a first-pass at a driver to add support for the Das Keyboard line of 'Cloud Connected' keyboards.

Currently, it talks only to the Cloud API (the local API is locked to localhost, which makes it basically worthless), and knows just enough to authenticate itself, and to send a notification to the Space bar.


v0.01 - Initial Release.
